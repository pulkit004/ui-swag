# About

This document outlines the plan for building a React application that can convert Swagger YAML or JSON into a user interface with forms, validations, and API calls. With a mobile-responsive approach, the application will be built using React, Typescript, Tailwind, and Antd.

The primary goal of this project is to eliminate the hassle of creating custom admin forms by automating the process with the help of Swagger YAML or JSON. The application will be able to generate forms based on the Swagger schema, validate user input, and make API calls to the backend.


# Setup

App is based on Eletron + React app framework


# Starting Development
Start the app in the dev environment:

yarn start

# Packaging for Production
To package apps for the local platform:
